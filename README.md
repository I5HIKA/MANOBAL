</h3>

<br>

## Introduction

Student mental health is a major issue in learning today. The pressure to succeed academically, combined with personal and social challenges, created stress for students. Aware of the seriousness of the problem, a major project is being undertaken to develop a state-of-the-art model and software called Manobal, which not only measures the mental health of students but also provides feedback that is beneficial to their development and provides good solutions.

### What is Manobal?

Manobal is a student assessment program that uses multiple methods to measure student health. This means that Manobal considers data from a variety of sources, including:

- Questions: Manobal uses well-designed questions that go beyond superficial research. It penetrates deeply into students' thoughts, feelings, and knowledge. These questions are designed to uncover stress, anxiety, and depression.
- Facial Expression Analysis: The integration of facial expression analysis into Manobal is a major advancement. Using digital technology, Manobal is able to detect small clues that can reveal underlying thoughts. The current evaluation gives a good idea of ​​students' positive opinions.
- Voice Modulation Analysis: The software also includes voice analysis that can detect changes in students' voice patterns. Changes in voice, pitch, and speech rate may be indicative of stress, anxiety, or other stressors.
- Physical and fitness data: Manobal also integrates with Google Fit API to collect students' physical and fitness data. This information can provide insight into students' health and wellbeing, which can help identify and address mental health issues.
